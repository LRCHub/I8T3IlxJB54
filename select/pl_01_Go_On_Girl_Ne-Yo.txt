I can't get it back
But I don't want it back
I realize that
she don't know how to act
Never been a dumb dude
No I'm not dense
I just has a slight
lack of common sense
I was the good guy
She was the bad girl
I'm thinking one girl
She's thinking Me
Earl James and Jimmy
Yep she had plenty
But love for me
she didn't have any
I was inviting
her into my heart
But she was out riding
in some other man's car
She was my night time
thought I was her stars
Guess I was wrong
but see I'm strong
Won't take long for me
to move on
Please don't worry
bout me I'm fine
Please don't worry
bout me I'm fine
Only gonna play
the fool one time
Only gonna play
the fool one time
Trust me when I say
that I'll be ok
Go on girl
Go on girl
Go on girl
I can't get it back
But I don't want it back
I realize that
she don't know how to act
Try to settle down
And look what I get
Thought it was my time
But I guess not yet
She at the bar getting drinks
From many men
I'm in the house thinking
she's with Her girlfriends
just not knowing
surely not knowing
I look back now
like man I was open
I was inviting
her into my heart
But she was out riding
in some other man's car
She was my night time
thought I was her stars
Guess I was wrong
but see I'm strong
Won't take long for me
to move on
Please don't worry
bout me I'm fine
Please don't worry
bout me I'm fine
Only gonna play
the fool one time
Only gonna play
the fool one time
Trust me when I say
that I'll be ok
Go on girl
Go on girl
Go on girl
The mistake I made is clear
We never should
I've been together
That's the reason
your not here
I know that I can
do much better
Not a single salty tear
Not a feeling in my chest
Baby I'm feeling no stress
I'm to fly to be depressed
Go on girl
Go on girl
Go on girl
Go on girl
Please don't worry
bout me I'm fine
Please don't worry
bout me I'm fine
Only gonna play
the fool one time
Only gonna play
the fool one time
Trust me when I say
that I'll be ok
Go on girl
Go on girl
Go on girl
Please don't worry
bout me I'm fine
Please don't worry
bout me I'm fine
Only gonna play
the fool one time
Only gonna play
the fool one time
Trust me when I say
that I'll be ok
Go on girl
Go on girl
Go on girl
Go on girl
Go on girl
Go on girl
I'll be fine
