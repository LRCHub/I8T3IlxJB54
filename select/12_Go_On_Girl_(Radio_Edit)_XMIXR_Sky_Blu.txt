I got a sweet tooth for that tootsie roll
Give me two when I'm good to go
I'm super rich if you didn't know
(He's super rich if you didn't know)
Got money ain't funny
Whatcha wanna say sunny
All day no work all play
By the beach I lay
With your bitch I lay
Stack more chips than a frito lay
I'm at the club and I'm wyling out
I'm at my house and I'm wyling out
Is that Mariah she wyling out
Tell Rick James son to get off my couch
Cause I'm super buzzed and I'm super high
Girls just call me super fly
I want you, you, you, you and you
In my room tonight

Go on girl! Get down!
Shake that ass like there's cash on the ground!
Go on girl! Get down!
This your chance show them fools what you about!
